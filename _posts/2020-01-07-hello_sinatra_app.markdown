Like any productive skill such as building, painting, etc...  programming rewards the executor with brief moments of frustration and elation. Those wonderful “Aha!” moments when the nagging question gets answered or the  persistent error gets resolved. These are great rewards to be enjoyed without a doubt, but also like any productive skill I’ve found the more lasting enjoyment is in when you are able to step back and take in the project as a whole with an eye on what’s next. 

It is more then just the knowledge that more of those revelatory moments are ahead, but also the excitement towards being able to apply those lessons learned along the way towards a next step or  production. A chance to test all those alternative structures and ideas which arise during any decision making. This is where I find myself after having completed my recent project in using Sinatra as I begin working with the Rails functionality, and I am relishing it.  

It's been difficult adjusting to wealth of tools and resources these platforms make available. An example: At the start I needed a way to display my errors on the screen to ensure my custom validation helpers were working as designed. Easy enough I thought, I have this session hash I can throw the message I want for each particular fail into a key there and have that displayed and then cleared each view render. This did work, but led to a quickly growing collection of various testing helpers to generate the messages.

Then I was told about Active Record's validation features and after a little reading of the documentation was able to clear lines of helper functionality and gain a range of functionality. Overall though it’s was a mistake worth making as it's always a valuable lesson to reinforce; look for the right tool before committing yourself to action. I already know this lesson will become especially relevent with my move to the Rails framework.
