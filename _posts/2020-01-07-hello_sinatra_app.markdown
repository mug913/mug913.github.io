Like any productive skill such as building, painting, etc...  programming rewards the executor with brief moments of frustration and elation. Those wonderful “Aha!” moments when the nagging question gets answered or the  persistent error gets resolved. These are great rewards to be enjoyed without a doubt, but also like any productive skill I’ve found the more lasting enjoyment is in when you are able to step back and take in the project as a whole with an eye on what’s next. 

It is more then just the knowledge that more of those revelatory moments are ahead, but also the excitement towards being able to apply those lessons learned along the way towards a next step or  production. A chance to test all those alternative structures and ideas which arise during any decision making. This is where I find myself after having completed my recent project in using Sinatra as I begin working with the Rails functionality, and I am relishing it.
